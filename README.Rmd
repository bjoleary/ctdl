# ctdl: Clinical Trials Downloader

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ctdl is to access [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) data from R. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ctdl like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bjoleary/ctdl")
```

## Example: Find and plot clinical trials associated with digital health topics

First, download the most recent clinical trials data: 

```{r download-data}
library(ctdl)
library(fs)
download_directory <- fs::path_temp()
download_data(filepath_data = download_directory)
```

Read in the study data: 

```{r read-studies}
studies <- read_studies(paste0(download_directory, "/"))
head(studies)
```

Create some search terms and associate them with topics:

```{r search-terms}
search_terms <- 
  tibble::tribble(
    ~term, ~topic,
    "Activity Monitor", "Wearable",
    "Activity Tracker", "Wearable",
    "Adaptive Algorithm", "AI/ML",
    "Android", "mHealth",
    "Apple Heart", "Wearable",
    "Apple Watch", "Wearable",
    "Apple Women", "mHealth",
    "Apple Hearing", "Wearable",
    "Artificial Intelligence", "AI/ML",

  ) |>
    # Add the escaped (\) word boundary term "\\b" to the beginning and end
    # of each search term.
    dplyr::mutate(regex_term = paste0("\\b", .data$term, "\\b"))
```

We'll also store some known false positives in a vector titled `known_fp`. 

```{r known-fp}
known_fp <- 
  c(
    "NCT03189251", "NCT04226612", "NCT00342394", "NCT00905346", "NCT00051363",
    "NCT01282814", "NCT04226612", "NCT00342394", "NCT00905346", "NCT00051363",
    "NCT01282814", "NCT00829452", "NCT00759954", "NCT00863915", "NCT00475605",
    "NCT00649467", "NCT00649805", "NCT00296127", "NCT01512459", "NCT00568152",
    "NCT00368719", "NCT01467570", "NCT01027117", "NCT01552252", "NCT01097226",
    "NCT01130051", "NCT01123395", "NCT02560077", "NCT02680119", "NCT01445964",
    "NCT02799433", "NCT01456507", "NCT03214276", "NCT01514019", "NCT01449786",
    "NCT01585519", "NCT01690676", "NCT01649492", "NCT01932112", "NCT02029781",
    "NCT01988389", "NCT02044419", "NCT02101112", "NCT02068014", "NCT02159313",
    "NCT02160158", "NCT02013856", "NCT02224365", "NCT02340039", "NCT02396615",
    "NCT02542033", "NCT02493140", "NCT02974491", "NCT03227874", "NCT02565472",
    "NCT03714464", "NCT04116580", "NCT03053986", "NCT02940249", "NCT03593135",
    "NCT02856893", "NCT03523403", "NCT03329638", "NCT03381664", "NCT03608319",
    "NCT03749031", "NCT03911050", "NCT03802682", "NCT03795324", "NCT03846986",
    "NCT04120259", "NCT04004182", "NCT04073719", "NCT01418625", "NCT00474682",
    "NCT00219388", "NCT00001330", "NCT00000335", "NCT01221116", "NCT00454974",
    "NCT01446965", "NCT01484938", "NCT01448005", "NCT01476722", "NCT01740999",
    "NCT01847105", "NCT02201706", "NCT03555123", "NCT03835390"
  )
```

Now we'll filter the `studies` tibble based on the search terms: 

```{r perform-search}
dh_studies <- 
  find_studies(
    data_studies = studies,
    search_terms = search_terms,
    known_fp = known_fp,
    max_topics = 5L
  ) |> 
  # Remove any studies with a start date in the future
  dplyr::filter(.data$start_date <= lubridate::today())
```

And, finally, we'll plot the results: 

```{r plot-results, fig.height=7, dpi=600}
plot_studies(
  studies = dh_studies,
  description = "Digital Health",
  this_year = lubridate::year(lubridate::today()),
  search_terms = search_terms
) |> 
  plot()
  
```
